# Content Projection In Angular
Reusable UI structures to simplify building complexÂ views

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.2.

## Blog Information
Content Projection is a powerful directive used within Angular and it allows us to encapsulate elements into components that are fully customisable. This is achieved by injecting custom HTML into these components. In other words, parts of the component would change based on the currently displayed screen and DOM.

This article demonstrates how Content Projection can simplify your code by breaking down complex views and creating reusable directives that remove duplication in your views.

I hope you can now see that Transclusion can help you improve your component reusability and ultimately to simplify dynamic DOM manipulation.

If you would like to learn more about this please have a look at the Official Documentation here, where you can learn other topics such as the default template.
